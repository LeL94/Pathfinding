- if setting target on target, target = None (and algorithm just explores)
- when showing exploration, draw path after exploration is finished
- ctrl + click to set walkable/blocked
- save map with tiles weights
- instructions / readme
- implement a way to measure algorithm's efficiency
- possibility to stop show_exploration
